# Machine Learning
Machine Learning relies on learning patterns based on sample data. </br>
There are three most common machine learning approaches: </br>
**1.Supervised learning** </br>
Supervisd learning works under supervision. In supervised learning the data which is provided is well-labelled data.Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.
some common supervised learning algorithms iclude: </br>
  * **Regression**  </br>
    It is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make predictions. </br>
     Example : Linear Regression, polynomial regression, Logistic Regression
  * **Classification** </br>
      Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes. It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data. </b>
      Example: KNN,SVM,Decision Trees,etc.

 **2. Unsupervised Learning** </br>
 It does not work under supervision. The sample data is unlabelled.In unsupervised algorithm we kind of don't know what we are looking for so problem itself is ambiguous.
 It is mainly based on clustering the data and making predictions.
 
 **3. Reinforcement Learning** </br>
 Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. the algorithm learns to react to an environment.
